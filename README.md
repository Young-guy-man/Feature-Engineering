# Description
Project 1 : Classify images of raisins as either Kecimen raisins or Besni raisins using Support Vector Machine(SVM) \
Project 2 : Implement different logistic regression classifiers, find the best ridge-regularized classifier using hyperparameter tuning, implement a tuned lasso-regularized feature selection method \
Project 3 : Use a logistic regression model to predict survey respondents are obese, then use wrapper method and compare the model accuracy
